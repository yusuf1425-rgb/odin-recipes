    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spaghetti is a classic comfort food in Stardew Valley, beloved by many as a simple but satisfying meal. 
        It restores a moderate amount of energy and a good amount of health.
        In-game, it is noted for being “an old favorite,” offering a hearty combination of pasta and fresh tomatoes.
